# DB_on_cycle

This repo contains the source code that realizes the simulation and the algorithm proposed in the paper (Not yet complished).

## fp_and_derivative.py
The realization of the proposed algorithm to calculate the fixation probabilities and their derivatives. Note that the sparse matrix method is not adopted here. Ask for the sparse matrix version by emailing at the authors.

## simulation.py
The simulation code to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm.
